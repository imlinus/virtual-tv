Here is my take on a "virtual tv", a personal cable tv station

My goal is to have something that feels like old school cable tv
You just put it on and it keeps playing random stuff

And my second goal is that it needs to be super easy to install for a regular non programmer
I like the concept jellyfin is using on windows, with a small little tray app and a website
So I think I'm going to aim for something similar
